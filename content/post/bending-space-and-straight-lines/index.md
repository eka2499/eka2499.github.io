TLDR: I want to understand the geometry in physics, such as curvature in GR, bundle theory and symmetries in gauge theory and symplectic geometry in classical mechanics. 
Recently, I attended a physics talk and realize they abuse all notation possible in general. Often they say vague non-sensical things like "This is a christoffel symbol and it 'contains info about curvature'"
without specifying anything more what that should mean and why it should be true.

To my understanding, one of the key ideas to understanding the world through geometry and curvature, is the idea that a force applied to a moving object changes the "straight line" it is moving in.
To formally do this, and easily extend it to any reasonable manifold, we need to intorduce diffgeo. These ideas may stuck with us for a few posts, if we are going to explore mathematical physics.
