TL:DR Why is this written?

## What is a spectral sequence?

### An example (fibrations yield SS...)

### A computation (Perhaps the cohomology (not ring struc) of $\Omega S^1$)

## Spectral sequences from chain complexes

## Spectral sequences from double complexes

## What about multicomplexes?



Perhaps for later articles:

* Spectral sequences for multicomplexes
* Why may the differentials be wonky? Ref. toy examples in Odins thesis
* Can we do a ninja trick?
* HTTT (Homotopy transfer theorem)
* Shifted seq to understand $d_2$(?)
* Iterated shifts TLDR and higher differentials

Also, why would a topologist care?
