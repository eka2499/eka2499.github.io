## Hey! Welcome to the blog!

### I'll tell you a bit about myself.

My name is Elias. I study mathematics at NTNU in Trondheim, and I have been doing that for the last couple of years. 
I expect to finish my master's degree in 2023. 
My main interests (at least during my master studies) are within algebraic topology, but honestly I am interested in a lot of topics ranging from mathematical physics to spatial statistics to stable homotopy theory.

During my first years, I were mostly interested in operator algebras, and my passion for topology and algebra at the time drove me to write a bachelor thesis about 
the operator K-theory and Morita theory of certain structures from time-frequency analysis called noncommutative tori. 
This thesis was supervised by Franz Luef and can be found under the 'documents ' page [here]({{< ref "/page/documents" >}} "Documents").

Apart from studying mathematics, I have been working a lot at the university, both as a teaching assistant and as a student representative at the programme, institute and faculty level.
If I am not doing anything "productive", I am usually bouldering, acting or sailing the best sailboat in the Trondheim area, which is a 34 foot Sweden Yatch C34 called "SY MARLEN" that I bought with a friend.


### What is this blog? 
This website/blog was set up by a friend of mine, Torgeir Aamb√∏, who is doing a PhD in tensor-triangulated geometry and also runs a blog on mathematics. I recommend you to check it out. A link can be found on the [links]({{< ref "/page/links" >}} "Links") page.

The aim of the blog is to explore mathematics. For more information on what you can expect from the posts and the mathematical content, please see the initial post on the [home page]({{< ref "/" >}} "Home").
