      <description>The last semester I have been thinking very little about this blog. The reason is that I had not developed any &amp;ldquo;writing habits&amp;rdquo;, and as I started on my master thesis this semester, there have been plenty of topics to learn about. Of course, I made this blog as a tool of learning, as explaining difficult topics forces me to learn them myself, but as the learning has been more about getting an overview, I have not prioritized writing a lot.</description>
