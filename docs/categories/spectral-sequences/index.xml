      <description>A year ago, I took a course on algebraic topology at NTNU where we covered some homotopy theory, spectral sequences, bundle theory and characteristic classes. Most of the topics stuck with me, and I have been exploring them a bit after the course. The part on spectral sequences grew on me, and at the end of the course, that part fascinated me the most, as they give a puzzle-style way of computing homology and cohomology.</description>
