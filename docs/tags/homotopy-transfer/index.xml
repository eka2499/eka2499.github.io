      <description>As promised when we started the series on spectral sequences and multicomplexes, we aimed at understanding the main results of a master thesis. Finally, I&amp;rsquo;ve had the time to finish this post. I enjoyed writing it quite a lot, but I have been busy with other things, such as acting for Realfagsrevyen and doing project work for other courses. Now that these things are more-or-less out of the way (for now), I finally managed to finish this post.</description>
