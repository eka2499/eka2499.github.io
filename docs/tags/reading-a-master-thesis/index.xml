      <description>Welcome back! In the previous post, we took a brief look at spectral sequences and how we could get them from filtered complexes. In this post, we will sketch the main ideas in a proof of the convergence of the Leray-Serre (LS) spectral sequence using techiques from homotopy theory, explore spectral sequences through exact couples and compute an example.
Originally, I planned to spend more time understanding exact couples and head towards the Adams spectral sequence, but as my friend Torgeir recently wrote a great post on this for his dive into (stable) homotopy theory, we&amp;rsquo;ll just briefly touch on the topic.</description>
