In the previous post, we took a brief look at spectral sequences and how we could get them from filtered complexes.
In this post, we will sketch the main ideas in a proof of the convergence of the Leray-Serre (LS) spectral sequence using techiques from homotopy theory, explore spectral sequences through exact couples and compute an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, I planned to spend more time understanding exact couples and head towards the Adams spectral sequence, but as my friend Torgeir recently wrote &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://torgeiraamboe.github.io/posts/2022/the-adams-spectral-sequence/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;a great post&lt;/a&gt;
on this for his dive into (stable) homotopy theory, we&amp;rsquo;ll just briefly touch on the topic. If you just want to see the computation, feel free to skip to the last chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;proving-the-convergence-of-the-leray-serre-spectral-sequence-using-homotopy-theory&#34;&gt;Proving the convergence of the Leray-Serre spectral sequence using homotopy theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement of the Leray-Serre spectral sequence is quite daunting. How would we go about proving such a thing? It may seem hard.
We start the post by proving the theorem that we stated in the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/p/spectral-sequences-and-multicomplexes-part-i/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; using the method of constructing a spectral sequence from a filtered complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem: (The Leray-Serre Spectral Sequence)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume $F \hookrightarrow E \to B$ is a fibration where $\pi_0(E) = 0$ and $\pi_1(B)=0$ (even better, just assume that $\pi_1(B)$ acts trivially on $H_*(F)$ and the result still holds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is a convergent first quadrant spectral sequence with $E^2$-page given by
$$ E^2_{p,q} = H_p(B;H_q(F)) \Rightarrow H_{p+q}(E).$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sketch of proof:&lt;/strong&gt; (Following &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://r0hilp.github.io/assets/docs/serre_spectral_sequence.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;this&lt;/a&gt; article)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are given a fibration $p: E \to B$ with fiber $F$. For simplicity&amp;rsquo;s sake, assume $B$ is a CW-complex. Strictly speaking, this &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT-CWapprox.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;can be done&lt;/a&gt; as every space we are interested in at the moment can be considered to be weakly equivalent to a CW-complex.
Let $B^p$ denote the $p$-skeleton of $B$. Then we take the singular chain complex, $C_* (E)$, of $E$ and define a filtration on this complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How? Well, we want to understand how it changes &lt;em&gt;levelwise&lt;/em&gt;, that is, how it changes when going between the cells.
Now, the only cells we are explicitly moving between are including the $B^{p-1}$&amp;rsquo;s  into the $B^{p}&amp;rsquo;s$.
Intuitively, we could have taken the chains $F_pC_* (E) = C_* (B^p)$ to yield the filtration, but $B^p$ does not live in $E$, so this doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense.
We would not be working with $C_* (E)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we remember that we have the fibration $p: E \to B$, we can just pull these skeleta back through $p$.
This leads us to defining $F_pC_* (E) = C_* (p^{-1}(B^p))$ as our filtration on $C_* (E)$.
Finding the associated graded, we obtain $G_pC_* (E) = C_* (p^{-1}(B^p),p^{-1}(B^{p-1}))$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By computing homology, we achieve the entries in the $E^1$-page as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$E_{p, q}^{1}=H_{p+q}\left(p^{-1}\left(B^p\right), p^{-1}\left(B^{p-1}\right)\right).$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differential is achieved the same way as last time, where we composed two maps coming from different long exact sequences in homology. That is, $d_1$ is the composition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$H_{p+q}\left(p^{-1}\left(B^{p}\right), p^{-1}\left(B^{p-1}\right)\right) \rightarrow H_{p+q-1}\left(p^{-1}\left(B^{p-1}\right)\right)$$
$$ \rightarrow H_{p+q-1}\left(p^{-1}\left(B^{p-1}\right), p^{-1}\left(B^{p-2}\right)\right).$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can of course just continue finding the rest of the pages and their differentials, as this will converge to $H_{p+q}(C_* (E)) =: H_{p+q}(E)$ due to the fact that we built our filtration on $p^{-1}(B^p)$, which will increase to $E$ as $p$ increases.
The problem is that this does not reference the explicit construction of the $E^2$-page that should be quite easy to compute.
Hence, we are going to show that the $E^2$-page can be written quite explicitely as $E^2_{p,q} = H_p(B;H_q(F))$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is defintitely the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crux_%28climbing%29&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;crux&lt;/a&gt; of the proof (for us), as we would need to show that the $E^1$-page consists of the cellular chain group $C_{p}^{C W}\left(B ; H_{q}(F)\right)$.
If this is the case, we would have the wanted $E^2$-page by taking homology and the fact that cellular homology coincides with singular homology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$C_p^{CW}(B;H_q(F)) \cong H_p(B^p, B^{p-1}) \otimes H_q(F) $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://topospaces.subwiki.org/wiki/Cellular_chain_complex&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;definition&lt;/a&gt; of the cellular chains with coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is known to the barely &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.dictionary.com/browse/cognoscenti&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;cognoscenti&lt;/a&gt; that $H_p(B^p, B^{p-1})$ is freely generated by the $p$-cells of $B$, meaning it is isomorphic to copies of a direct sum of $\mathbb{Z}$, indexed over some $\alpha$&amp;rsquo;s.
Therefore, we have $C_p^{CW}(B;H_q(F)) \cong \oplus_{\alpha}H_q(F)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to analyse this further, consider the characteristic map $\phi_{\alpha}$ of $D_{\alpha}$, that is, the map indicating how to glue the $p$-disk $D_{\alpha}$ to $B^{p-1}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use this, along with the fibration, to consider the following pullback diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this fun to do? Well, we want to connect the $p$-cells generating the cellular chain groups with $(p^{-1}(B^p), p^{-1}(B^{p-1}))$, and pullbacking may yield some &amp;ldquo;middle ground&amp;rdquo; that we can utilise towards this purpose.
To keep notation consistent and remember &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we glued on $D_{\alpha}$, the preimage $\xi_{\alpha}^{-1}(S_{\alpha}) = \xi_{\alpha}^{-1}(\partial D_{\alpha})$ is denoted by $\tilde{S_{\alpha}}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we consider all the pairs $(\tilde{D_{\alpha}}, \tilde{S_{\alpha}})$, we can map them over to $(p^{-1}(B^p), p^{-1}(B^{p-1}))$ using the $\phi_{\alpha}$&amp;rsquo;s.
That is, we combine them to one map&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\phi^* : \coprod_{\alpha}(\tilde{D_{\alpha}}, \tilde{S_{\alpha}}) \to (p^{-1}(B^p), p^{-1}(B^{p-1})).$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this map of pairs of spaces is actually an isomorphism when passed through $H_{p+q}$. To me, this is not clear from what we have done so far.
Trying to study the cells we are gluing and pullbacking to obtain middle ground seems fair, but the fact that this works out, is kind of magical to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;reason&amp;rdquo; this is true is because we can do some ninja-tricks and apply excision to the right hand side.
This would not change the homology groups, but it could certainly yield a different way of viewing this map.
We won&amp;rsquo;t go into the details as it is a messy procedure, which means that the crux (of what we actually show) is behind us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step involves showing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\oplus_{\alpha}  H_{p+q}(\tilde{D_{\alpha}}, \tilde{S_{\alpha}}) \cong \oplus_{\alpha} H_{q}(F).$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To briefly explain why this is true, one can do some tricks making an upper and lower hemisphere of the $\tilde{D_{\alpha}}$&amp;rsquo;s by using the $\xi_{\alpha}$&amp;rsquo;s. They are denoted by subscripted signs, such as $\tilde{D_{\alpha,-}}$ for the lower hemisphere.
Playing with the boundary maps and induced inclusions, we get the following picture, stolen from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATch5.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hatchers chapter on spectral sequences&lt;/a&gt;.
It shows a zig-zag tracing down simpler versions of the homology groups we are after.
We omit the index $\alpha$, but to log which dimension we are working with, we include superscripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The space $H_q(\tilde{D_+^0})$ can be shown to be exactly $H_q(F)$ by utilising the maps $\phi_{\alpha}$, as well as the assumption that $\pi_1(B)$ is trivial, or at least acts trivially on the homology $H_* (F)$.
We won&amp;rsquo;t delve into it any more, but we refer to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATch5.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hatcher&lt;/a&gt; for the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these technical parts behind us (which we did/did not prove to some extent), we can combine the isomorphisms to get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$C_p^{CW}(B;H_q(F)) \cong H_p(B^p, B^{p-1}) \otimes H_q(F) \cong \oplus_{\alpha}H_q(F)$$
$$\cong \oplus_{\alpha} H_{q}(F) \cong \oplus_{\alpha}  H_{p+q}(\tilde{D_{\alpha}}, \tilde{S_{\alpha}}) \cong  H_{p+q}(\coprod_{\alpha}(\tilde{D_{\alpha}}, \tilde{S_{\alpha}}))$$
$$ \cong H_{p+q}(p^{-1}(B^p), p^{-1}(B^{p-1})) \cong E_{p,q}^1.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The differential $d_1$ coincides with the cellular boundary map $\partial$ as well, yielding the same homology, hence giving the wanted $E^2$-page!
We won&amp;rsquo;t show this, as it is quite technical, but it can be found in &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATch5.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hatchers chapter&lt;/a&gt;.
The same can be said about showing this construction is well-defined with respect to choosing a different CW-approximations to $B$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that we got the $E^1$-page from a filtration of $C_ * (E)$ specifying the $E^0$-page.
As mentioned, this means that we will certainly have a spectral sequence converging to the homology of $E$.
Luckily for us, we were able to show that the $E^2$-page took such a computable form, which we will use later to compute a toy example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spectral-sequences-from-exact-couples---a-more-general-approach&#34;&gt;Spectral sequences from exact couples - A more general approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we just saw, the previous method of finding the Leray-Serre spectral sequence involved some technical homotopy theory, and that is after we referenced most parts to Hatcher!
There are a vast spectrum (pun intended) of (co)homology theories out there, and the technical homotopy theory can be difficult to do in general scenarios. If we want something easily computable, we would probably need to do such technical work.
For other theories, we may need to be happy with the mere existence of the spectral sequence before we find explicit formulae.
It is interesting to know if we can find these sequences at all!
Are there other ways to find spectral sequences? Yes, indeed, there is an alternative way through &lt;em&gt;exact couples&lt;/em&gt;.
It turns out that we can derive all interesting spectral sequences this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The method is based on the following staircase diagram, which we borrow from &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/ATch5.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Hatcher&lt;/a&gt;.
For this section, let $X$ be a finite dimensional CW-complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we denote $M = \oplus_{p,q} H_{p+q}(X_p)$ and $N = \oplus_{p,q} H_{p+q}(X_p,X_{p-1})$, we can put these staircases together into one diagram, where the arrows are the ones coming from the staircase drawing.
Since there are only two objects involved and the diagram is exact in every object, this is called an exact couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the vertical composition of maps in the drawing of the staircase diagram correspond to the cellular differentials for $p=n$, that is, the boundary maps $H_{n+1}\left(X_{n+1}, X_{n}\right) \to H_{n}\left(X_{n}, X_{n-1}\right)$.
Hence, studying $d=jk$ in the exact couple, could be quite interesting, as this encapsulates all &amp;ldquo;levels&amp;rdquo; of these cellular groups.
Indeed, since $kj=0$, we obtain $d^2=jkjk=j0k=0$. We have a differential, meaning we can form the homology group.
This yields a sequence $\cdots \to N \to N \to N \to \cdots$, where each map is the differential $d=jk$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forming the homology groups, we obtain what we call a &lt;em&gt;derived couple&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;707px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the derived couple, we try to define things in the &amp;ldquo;only way&amp;rdquo; we can, namely as,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$N&amp;rsquo; = \frac{Ker d_0}{Im d_0}, \quad M&amp;rsquo; = Im(i)=Ker(j), \quad i&amp;rsquo; = i |_{M&amp;rsquo;}, \quad j&amp;rsquo;=ji^{-1}, \quad k&amp;rsquo; = \bar{k},$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\bar{k}$ is $k$, but just on homology classes and $i^{-1}$ means picking an element in the preimage.
These constructions turns out to be well-defined with respect to choosing representatives for the homology classes and preimages,
simply by writing out what they should mean and applying exactness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By some diagram chasing, it turns out that the derived couple is exact! Hence, homology takes in an exact couple and spits out an exact couple!
Doing the same procedure with $d&amp;rsquo;=j&amp;rsquo;k&amp;rsquo;$, we can make a new derived couple with entries $M&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, N&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;$ and maps $i&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, j&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;, k&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;$, yielding an exact sequence!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking the $r$&amp;lsquo;th iteration of this process as the layout for the $E^r$-page, we get a spectral sequence with differentials as above.
The only reasonable choice we can make, is to take $E_{n, p}^{1}=H_{n}\left(X_{p}, X_{p-1}\right)$.
By doing the &amp;ldquo;same procedure&amp;rdquo; as before, we get a spectral sequence when iterating through these exact- and derived couples.
Indeed, it can be shown that this converges to $H_ * (X)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is extremely powerful, as Torgeir explains in his &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://torgeiraamboe.github.io/posts/2022/the-adams-spectral-sequence/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-detour-to-more-general-cohomology-theories&#34;&gt;A detour to more general cohomology theories.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain some of the power of this construction, we have really only used that $H^* $ has a long exact sequence for pairs.
Hence, we can actually take any cohomology theory $\mathcal{E}^ * $ and do a similar thing. Strictly speaking, this would give us a &lt;em&gt;cohomological&lt;/em&gt; spectral sequence looking like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$E_2^{p, q}=H^p\left(X ; \pi_{-q} \mathcal{E}\right) \Rightarrow \mathcal{E}^{p+q}(X),$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\mathcal{E}$ is the spectra representing the cohomology theory, and the coefficients are given by the homotopy groups of spectra, where we have defined&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\pi_k(\mathcal{E})=\operatorname{colim}_{n \rightarrow \infty} \pi _ {n+k} (\mathcal{E}_n)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for all $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We won&amp;rsquo;t jump into the homotopy theory going on here, but the idea still holds if we ignore working with the coefficients and the convergence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By defining&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$M = \oplus_{p, q}\mathcal{E}^ {p+q}(X_ p ), \quad N = \oplus_{p, q}\mathcal{E}^{p+q}(X_p,X _ {p-1} ),$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and letting the maps come from the setup of a cohomological staircase diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, letting $E^{p,q}_1 = \mathcal{E}^ {p+q} (X_p,X _ {p-1}) $ be the first page of the spectral sequence, we can just iterate the construction as mentioned earlier to retrieve a spectral sequence
in the cohomology theory $ \mathcal{E}^* $!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;computing-the-homology-of-omega-sn&#34;&gt;Computing the homology of $\Omega S^n$.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the Leray-Serre sequence to compute the homology of $\Omega S^n$, we need a fibration where this space is one of the main players.
The fibration we will use is the path space fibration, namely $\Omega X \to PX \to X$, for a based space $X$.
$PX$ is given by continuous maps from $[0,1]$ to $X$ sending $0$ to the base point of $X$. This space is contractible, which is going to be important for our computation.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last map in the fibration is then given by evaluating the path in $1$. The fibers can be shown to be homotopy equivlent. We can therefore just pick the preimage at the basepoint to be the fiber, which is what we do!
The loop space is exactly the fiber of this map at the basepoint, and is therefore defined as continuous (based) maps $S^1 \to X$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we choose $X$ to be an arbitrary sphere $S^n$, we want to try to compute the homology of $\Omega S^n$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, what do we need to do? Well, if we want to use the Leray-Serre spectral sequence, we know that it is given by
$$ E^2_{p,q} = H_p(B;H_q(F)) \Rightarrow H_{p+q}(E).$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this fibration, this would look like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ E^2_{p,q} = H_p(S^n;H_q(\Omega S^n)) \Rightarrow H_{p+q}(PS^n) = H_{p+q}( * ).$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We certainly know the homology of the sphere and the path space, as the path space has the same homology as the point, so we would need to utilise the differentials
in order to say anything about the homology of $\Omega S^n$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, what does the second page look like? By the universal coefficient theorem, we can find the $E^2$-page.
The entries on the page is given by $H_q(\Omega S^n)$ if $p=0$ or $p = n$ and $q \geq 0$, and $0$ elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is the $E^2$-page, some magic would need to happen before arriving at the $E^{\infty}$-page.
The magic that should happen, would need to &amp;ldquo;remove&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;kill off&amp;rdquo; all the entries outside of $(p,q) = (0,0)$, as the only nontrivial homology of $PX$ is for $n = p+q = 0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To end at the page above, we would need to change the entries a bit.
The way the entries on a page change is that they are hit by, or send out, a nontrivial differential, as this would change the entries when moving to the next page through homology.
Observe that due to the structure of the $E^2$-page, no differentials will hit anything, unless $n=2$.
Hence, the $E^2$-page will be similar to the $E^3$-page, and so on.
We get these results up to the $E^n$-page, i.e. $E^2 \cong E^3 \cong \ldots \cong E^n$.
On the $E^n$-page, something (finally) happens. We know the differentials would need to go from an entry where $p=n$ and $n$ steps to the left to be able to hit anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the entries at $(n,t)$ for $t &amp;lt; 0$ are all $0$, we know that the differentials on the $n$&amp;lsquo;th page will go from $E^n_{n,t}$ for $-(n-1)&amp;lt;t&amp;lt;0$ and hit the corresponding entries $E^n_{0,s}$ for $0&amp;lt;s&amp;lt;n-1$.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the latter collection of entries all need to disappear before reaching the final page, these differentials must be isomorphisms $0 \to E^n_{0,s}$.
The reason is that the $E^n$-page is the final page where we can have nonzero differentials, due to degree reasons.
Hence, we get that $E^{n+1}$ is the final page, so $E^{n+1} \cong \ldots \cong E^{\infty}$, and at that page we must have only the coefficient ring for $p+q=0$, as it is the homology of $PX$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mentioned isomorphism yields that the entries $E^n_{0,s}$ are $0$, and since they are the same entries as $E^n_{n,s}$, we get columns of zeros both for $p=0$ and for $p=n$.
Doing this again with the maps going from an $E^n_{n,s}$ for $0&amp;lt;s&amp;lt;n-1$ to the corresponding $E^n_{0,k}$ for $n-1&amp;lt;k&amp;lt;2(n-1)$, we also get zeros.
This can be iterated to see that we get zeros in these columns, only interrupted by the coefficient ring when $q = m(n-1)$ for $m = 0,1,\ldots$.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we know the homology of the point, we must have that all entries that have survived so far must also be killed, except for the entry in $(0,0)$.
This entry can&amp;rsquo;t be killed, and as the homology of the point is the coefficent ring at $p+q=0$, we can fill in that this must be $\mathbb{Z}$ for $(0,0)$.
Since this entry is the same at the entry $(n,0)$, we can place a $\mathbb{Z}$ there as well..
The differential that will kill off the $\mathbb{Z}$ in $(n,0)$ must be an isomorphism, as it can leave only $0$ when taking homology.
This yields two new $\mathbb{Z}$&amp;rsquo;s, which can then be used to argue that all the remaining entries must be $\mathbb{Z}$ by observing that the remaining differentials must be isomorphisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now know the homology of $\Omega S^n$!
Take a look at what the entries were, and you&amp;rsquo;ll find that we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$H_k( \Omega S^n) = \mathbb{Z} \quad \text{for} \quad k = m(n-1), \quad m=0,1,\ldots \quad \text{and} \quad 0 \quad \text{elsewhere}.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this (hopefully) illustrative example, we finish up the post. For the next post, I expect us to dive into spectral sequences from multicomplexes, which is what my friend Odin wrote his master thesis about.
I can&amp;rsquo;t guarantee that, as I recently held a talk on Joyals lifting theorem and $\infty$-categories. I&amp;rsquo;d like to dedicate a post to that, or maybe some homotopy theory, spatial statistics or differential cohomology.
Time will tell!&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://eka2499.github.io/p/spectral-sequences-and-multicomplexes-part-i/images/SpecSeqds2.png" alt="Featured image of post Spectral sequences and multicomplexes - Part I" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I took a course on algebraic topology at NTNU where we covered some homotopy theory, spectral sequences, bundle theory and characteristic classes.
Most of the topics stuck with me, and I have been exploring them a bit after the course. The part on spectral sequences grew on me, and at the end of the course, that part fascinated me the most, as they give a puzzle-style way of computing homology and cohomology.
Even though I realised that they were powerful tools, there were a lot of technicalities that I just &amp;ldquo;accepted&amp;rdquo; when it came to spectral sequences.
I have not been using them, or even thinking about them, for a while now, and I thought it would be nice to &amp;ldquo;open the blackbox&amp;rdquo; to understand them properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fellow student of mine, Odin, recently handed in his master thesis in algebraic topology where he explored the spectral sequence associated to a multicomplex over a field.
Trying to understand the main essence of the results in his thesis is what lead me to writing this post.
We will start the mathematical exploration of this blog with an introduction to spectral sequences before we delve into the main results in Odins master thesis in some later post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-spectral-sequence&#34;&gt;What is a spectral sequence?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loosely speaking, a (co)homological spectral sequence consists several &lt;em&gt;pages&lt;/em&gt; of chain complexes of abelian groups such that the pages are connected by (co)homology.
The idea we will try to capsule into the spectral sequence is that we will make a finer and finer approximation to the homology of a space.
Between the abelian groups, we have differentials that &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; their angle for each page we iterate through, allowing us to gather up some new (finer) info in homology for each page.
Information of the homology of what from what, you may ask? We&amp;rsquo;ll come to that. First we explore the mechanisms of a spectral sequence, so that we can more easily grasp the technicalities they originated from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reveal some of the notation before we derive the ideas ourselves, it is common (up to convention) to write $(E^r_{**}, d^r_{* *}).$ This indicates that we would have abelian groups $E^r_{p,q}$ in a grid and differentials $d^r_{p,q} : E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r,q+r-1}$ squaring to zero on the $r$&amp;lsquo;th page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s try to visualise what this is supposed to look like if we try to work with a spectral sequence.
First of all, we have abelian groups in a grid, indexed by which page $r$ we are working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between these groups, we are supposed to have differentials moving left and up, depending on which page we are working on.
Let&amp;rsquo;s try to visualise what the $d_1, d_2$ and $d_3$ differentials look like on this page.&lt;/p&gt;

		alt=&#34;On the first page we see some of the $d_1$ differentials. Note that the differentials go one to the left. One example of a vanishing differential is the map $E_{0,0}^1 \to E_{-1,0}^1$, which vanishes as $E_{-1,0}^1$ is zero in this first quadrant spectral sequence.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we move to the later pages (e.g. $r=2$ or $r=3$), the differentials change. Keep in mind that the groups also change, as we move through the pages by taking homology with respect to the differentials we just worked with.
For $r=2$, the page could look like the following:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://eka2499.github.io/p/spectral-sequences-and-multicomplexes-part-i/images/SpecSeqd22.png&#34;

	loading=&#34;lazy&#34;
	
		alt=&#34;For $r=2$, we can look at the selected differentials to see that the differentials change their directions slightly. On the second page they go two to the left and one up, instead of one to the left. Do not forget that the groups in each entry may have changed since the previous page.&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this look for $r=3$ then? Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look!&lt;/p&gt;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;168&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;404px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. What we can see now, is that as we progress through the pages, the differentials more and more often end up left of the first quadrant, and hence vanish, as all the abelian groups outside the first quadrant is zero in this &lt;em&gt;first quadrant spectral sequence&lt;/em&gt;.
This would mean that for a sufficiently large $r$, all the differentials end up outside of the first quadrant and vanish. When taking homology with zero as the differentials, we just end up with the same thing.
Therefore, for a sufficiently large $r$, we have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$E_{p,q}^r = E_{p,q}^{r+1}=\cdots=E_{p,q}^{\infty},$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we say that the sequence &lt;em&gt;degenerates&lt;/em&gt; at page $r$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This terminal page is where the magic happens. As we have (in some sense that will become clear later) included finer and finer homological data, we may actually find some sort of homological information here. Exactly why this is a good idea to do, is yet to be explained.
Before we answer the question on where these ideas come from, we ask whether or not there are any interesting spectral sequences we can consider.
The example we will come back to and try out a bit, is the Leray-Serre spectral sequence. This may often be stated as a theorem, as its convergence is certainly not to take for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem: (The Leray-Serre Spectral Sequence)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assume $F \hookrightarrow E \to B$ is a fibration where $\pi_0(E) = 0$ and $\pi_1(B)=0$ (even better, assume that $\pi_1(B)$ acts trivially on $H_*(F)$ and the result still holds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is a convergent first quadrant spectral sequence with $E^2$-page given by
$$ E^2_{p,q} = H_p(B;H_q(F)) \Rightarrow H_{p+q}(E).$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can we think of this? Well, we just visualised a grid of abelian groups, and this theorem says that we can choose the entries in the grid on the second page to contain information about the homology of the base space and the fiber in a fibration to retrieve information about the homology of the total space when iterating through the pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, we have some words to clarify before we understand this.
What is a fibration and how would such a weird mix-up of homology groups converge to anything, let alone the homology of $E$? There are a lot of questions to be answered, but we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to them. We will take a detour to homotopy theory to understand fibrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-detour-to-homotopy-theory&#34;&gt;A detour to homotopy theory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though you can do a post about spectral sequences without touching that much topology, we visit homotopy theory.
Fibrations come from homotopy theory, and along with the notions of weak equivalences and cofibrations (the dual notion of fibrations), they make up the stepping stones for the theory.
In fact, if we would want to do homotopy theory in other contexts (that is, in other categories), we couldn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily just &amp;ldquo;continuously deform&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;draw a continuous path&amp;rdquo; between homotopic functions.
We would need the categorical notion of a model category, which is specified by fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences. We may encounter them in later posts, but for now, we won&amp;rsquo;t dwell on these ideas before we have worked a bit with fibrations. Fibrations are maps with a special property, namely the &lt;em&gt;homotopy lifting property&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition: (Homotopy Lifting Property)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a map of topological spaces $p: E \to B$, we say $p$ has the &lt;em&gt;homotopy lifting property&lt;/em&gt; with respect to a space $X$ if, given a homotopy $g_t: X \to B$ and a lift $\tilde{g_0}:X \to E$ of the starting map $g_0$ in the homotopy,
there exists a homotopy $\tilde{g_t}:X \to E$ lifting $g_t$ and extending $\tilde{g_0}$. Phrased as a diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition: (Fibration)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;fibration&lt;/em&gt; $p: E \to X$ is a map having this homotopy lifting property with respect to all topological spaces $X$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call $F_x := p^{-1}(x)$ the fiber at $x$. If the base space $B$ is path connected, the different fibers are all homotopy equivalent.
This leads us to talk about just &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; fiber $F$ and this justifies the notation $F \hookrightarrow E \to B$ for fibrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most known fibrations is the Hopf fibration,
$S^1 \hookrightarrow S^3 \to S^2$,
where the last morphism can be given explicitly, if we wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of spectral sequences is now that we can utilize the homology of $B$ and $F$ to find the homology of $E$, or even reverse-engineer it to find the homology of one of them, given that we know the homology of the two others.
This is exactly what we will do when we compute the homology of the loop space $\Omega S^n = Hom_{Top_*}(S^1,S^n)$ in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try to visualise this idea, think of a fiber bundle $p: E \to B$. If you do not know what a fiber bundle is, think about a manifold $B$ where the total space $E$ is the space $B$, but now every point has a fiber $F$ glued on.
The map $p$ then takes a point $(b,F_b)$ and projects down to $b$. Throw in some localising conditions (to make sure we locally glue them on in (close to) the same direction), and tada, you basically have the definition of a fiber bundle.
If the fibers are vector spaces, we call them vector bundles. Think about them as the collection of all (co)tangent spaces on your manifold, where all these spaces are glued onto the points to which they belong. This construction is quite important, so we will meet it again later, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can show that all fiber bundle maps over paracompact base spaces are fibrations.
The lifting condition now says that if we have a homotopy $g_t$ on our base space $B$, and a way to start the homotopy in the total space $E$, we can lift the homotopy to $E$.
Even though the homotopy is between functions, I like to think of them as paths. This would then mean that if we knew &amp;ldquo;a path&amp;rdquo; in $B$ and where it starts in $E$, we can transfer the entire &amp;ldquo;path&amp;rdquo; up to $E$ through the fibration $p$.
Now, enough with the hand waving and the homotopy theory for now. Let&amp;rsquo;s get back to spectral sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spectral-sequences-from-filtered-complexes&#34;&gt;Spectral sequences from filtered complexes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first part of this post, we drew some grids of abelian groups and had some differentials going weird directions. For now, we start from scratch, kind of forgetting what we did in the earlier sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that we often find ourselves in situations where we have a space $X$ and a subspace $A$. Often, we also can consider triplets of spaces $A \subset B \subset X$.
These will both yield long exact sequences in homology that relate the homology of these spaces. Note that if we consider the singular $n$-chains, we will get a sequence of inclusions
$C_n(A) \hookrightarrow C_n(B) \hookrightarrow C_n(X)$, and indeed, if we avoid choosing an $n$, we get a sequence of chain complexes $C_ * (A) \hookrightarrow C_ * (B) \hookrightarrow C_*(X)$ that contain a lot of the homological information relating these.
If we want, we can apply homology to get a sequence looking quite similar.
A natural question to ask is whether or not we can try to utilize this sort of filtration to compute homology levelwise and make it &amp;ldquo;converge&amp;rdquo; to the homology of $X$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have $A \subset B \subset X$ or even $A \subset B \subset C \subset X$, what info do we need about the homologies related to the subspaces of $X$ before we can compute the homology of $X$?
To be intentionally vague, we can set up the homologies after each other, with the respective homologies of the quotient spaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar story can be told for the longer filtrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like we &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; need the homologies of the subspaces with their respective quotients to compute the homologies upwards in this chain.
If we can properly define what a filtration is supposed to mean, and actually work out whow this &amp;ldquo;levelwise&amp;rdquo; construction is supposed to work, then we are possibly onto some sort of idea of &amp;ldquo;approximating the homology of $X$ with finer and finer information&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition: (Filtration of a module)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;filtration&lt;/em&gt; of a module $M$ is a sequence of subspaces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\cdots \subset F_{-1}M \subset F_0M \subset F_1M \subset \cdots$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;such that their union is $M$ and their intersection is $\empty$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition: (Filtered complex)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A filtered complex is a chain complex $(C,\partial)$  such that we have a filtration on each entry preserving the boundary map, i.e. each $C_i$ has a filtration such that $\partial F_jC_i \subset F_jC_{i-1}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One should note that $F_pC_ * $ is a subcomplex of $C_*$, so we have basically just filtered the entire complex at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can try to utilise the idea from earlier about finding the information about the quotient spaces, and construct the associated graded module from a filtered module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition: (Associated graded module)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a filtration on a module $M$, we can define the &lt;em&gt;associated graded module&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$GM = \bigoplus_{i \in \mathbb{Z}}G_iM,$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $G_iM = F_iM/F_{i-1}M$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the previous case, we can do the same thing for complexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition: (Associated graded complex)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given a filtered complex $C_*$, we can define the &lt;em&gt;associated graded complex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$G_pC_* = F_pC_* / F_{p-1}C_* , $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where the quotient is taken as chain complexes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remark:&lt;/strong&gt; The filtration on $C_ * $ induces a filtration on its homology, so we can in fact talk about the graded structures on the homology of $C_* $ as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that if we consider a (good) pair of spaces $A \subset X$, we can in fact compute $H(X)$ from $H(A)$ and $H(X/A)$ up to some extension problem, as illustrated above.
If we can pick a filtration of $C_ * $ with easily computeable homology, maybe we can compute the homology of $C_ *$ itself, in nice enough contexts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now you can again recall what we did in the first section.
A spectral sequence is supposed to consist of a grid of abelian groups (or modules) $E^r_{p,q}$ with differentials $d^r_{p,q} : E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r,q+r-1}$, whatever that means.
Since the differentials shift and move further and further away as we progress towards the pages, a suitable boundedness condition may ensure that all of these differentials vanish, at some point, meaning that the sequence &lt;em&gt;degenerates&lt;/em&gt;.
For example, this happens in the Leray-Serre sequence, as that spectral sequence is a first quadrant sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A natural question, following what we just did, is whether or not we can just plug the groups $H_* (G_pC_ * )$ into some spectral sequence and hope that this spits out information about $H_* (C_ * )$ on the $E^{\infty}$-page.
We are close to the answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theorem: (Existence of a spectral sequence)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are given a filtered complex $C_ * $ with some filtration $F$ as in the above definitions, there exists a spectral sequence $E$ such that $E_{p,q}^{\infty}$ is equal to $G_pH_{p+q}(C_ * )$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow! On the final page, we can actually find all the steps in the filtration of the homology of $C_ * $!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this situation, we say that $E$ &lt;em&gt;abuts&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;converges&lt;/em&gt; to $H_{p+q}(C_ * )$, as in the case of the Leray-Serre spectral sequence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not prove this, as the post is already long enough, but we will try to understand a bit where this comes from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-main-idea&#34;&gt;The main idea&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is (almost) natural to take $E_{p,q}^0$ to be $G_pC_{p+q}$. The most natural choice would be to consider $G_pC_q$, but it turns out that everything gets hard if we do that.
The differential $d_0$ can only be chosen to be the boundary map $E_{p,q}^0 = G_pC_{p+q} \to G_pC_{p+q-1} = E_{p,q-1}^0$.
Just to see what this would look like, let&amp;rsquo;s bring up the grid again.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if we take homology with respect to $d_0$, what happens? We define the $E^1$-page!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $E^1$-page becomes $E^1_{p,q} = H_{p+q}(G_pC_ * )$. If we want to find the differential $d_1$, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t base it on $d_0$, as we already killed off every single image of $d_0$ when taking homology. Nevertheless, there is a way!
Recall that we want to have a map from one of the $E^1_{p,q} = H_{p+q}(G_pC_ * )$ to a $E^1_{p&amp;rsquo;,q&amp;rsquo;} = H_{p&amp;rsquo;+q&amp;rsquo;}(G_{p&amp;rsquo;}C_ * )$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we consider the filtrations we have worked with earlier, we may find something interesting. For example, we can consider the short exact sequences&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$0 \to F_{p-1}C_ * \to F_pC_ * \to G_pC_ * \to 0$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$0 \to F_{p-2}C_ * \to F_{p-1}C_ * \to G_{p-1}C_ * \to 0.$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we have $F_{p-1}C_ * $ in both of them, we may be able to link $G_pC_ * $ to $ G_{p-1}C_ * $.
We want to link them in homology, so by taking the long exact sequences in homology, we can just trace the following web of arrows to define $d_1$ as the composition of the crossing arrows from both of the long exact sequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This arrow goes straight to the left and gives us in fact a new differential, as $d_1 ^2 = 0$, which could be seen by tracing out what $d_1^2$ would look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, we could take homology again, yielding the $E^2$ page and the respective $E_{p,q}^2$-groups.
The differential is a little bit more involved, but through a similar prosedure as for $d_1$, with some lifting of homology classes to representatives, one can make a well-defined differential $d_2: E_{p,q}^2 \to E_{p-2,q+1}^2$.

&lt;p&gt;After this point, one can continue in a similar fashion to produce all the pages that will determine the filtration of the yet unknown homology of $C_* $.
There are of course a lot of details to be checked, so we refer interested readers to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://r0hilp.github.io/assets/docs/serre_spectral_sequence.pdf&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we have done a lot of the &amp;ldquo;dirty work&amp;rdquo; when it comes to understanding spectral sequences.
We will probably see some applications of this in the next post, using the Leray-Serre Spectral Sequence to compute the homology of $\Omega S^n$, illustrating the beautiful methods of computing homology we have developed.&lt;br&gt;
